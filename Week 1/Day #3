	
What we have done:

    Started the day at 8am
    Watching the starter issues on github for Nextcloud contacts app that our mentor Jan suggested to us
    We had a video call at 2pm with our supervisor, mentor and coaches in order to catch up and introduce ourselves
    Created a project on github (better solution than Trello) to organize our workflow
    Looking for help and communicating with our team will be done on IRC (#nextcloud-contacts and #nextcloud-dev on Freenode)
    Created the first pull request on github
