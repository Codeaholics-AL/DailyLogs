# Hello world! 

We started our first day working on Nextcloud as part of RGSoC'17. What we will be working on during this summer is the Contacts app and the Documentation, that's why on our first day we have checked the beginners issues in order to prioritize them and get familiar with the code. Also we are refreshing our Angular.js knowledge that we will need for the Nextcloud project. We have joined the IRC channels  #nextcloud-dev and #nextcloud-contacts to get in touch with other contributors from our community.

On Wednesday we will have the first call with our supervisor Benedikt. Stay tuned for more information! :)
