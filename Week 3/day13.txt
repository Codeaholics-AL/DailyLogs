What we have done

    The day didn't start very good because Jona's laptop was broken :(. So we had to format it again and install Ubuntu. Then we installed Nextcloud and development environment again. It was easier this time.
    We also took a team photo and shared it on our twitter account.
    Then we had the call with our supervisor and coaches and we informed him about our progress so far.
