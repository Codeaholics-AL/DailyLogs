What we have done:

    Started working at 9am
    We had a coffee at Mulliri Vjeter in order to wake up and start the day with AngularJS
    Working on the issues #244 and #255, we did some tests with two different versions of Nextcloud and we found that those issues were already fixed on the current version that we are working on
    Still working on the issue #253
    Created a github organization for our team
